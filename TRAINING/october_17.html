        <h2>CSS Pseudo Classes</h2>
        <p>A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s).</p>
        <p>A pseudo-class consists of a colon (:) followed by the pseudo-class name. A functional pseudo-class also contains a pair of parentheses to define the arguments. The element that a pseudo-class is attached to is defined as an anchor element.</p>
